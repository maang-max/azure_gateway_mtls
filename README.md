What is mTLS Mutual TLS? 
MTLS stands for Mutual Transport Layer Security. It is an extension of the Transport Layer Security (TLS) protocol that provides an additional layer of security by requiring both the client and the server to authenticate each other using digital certificates. This ensures that both parties in a communication are who they claim to be, and it helps prevent man-in-the-middle attacks.
